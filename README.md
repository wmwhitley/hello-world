Just another repository

MBA srudent looking to learn coding as another tool to add to my repertoire and increase my value to myself through own life skills as well as to potential employers. I enjoy video games, cycling, soccer & shooting guns. Since technology is also a passion of mine, it seemed only fitting to learn how things work on the backend of the software that so engages me.
